This is the supplementary page for Professor Mosby's section of LLO 8200 Introduction to Data Science. **Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for Async lectures and homework assignments.** Over the course of the term code may be optimized or corrected, so please alert me if you’re going to be working ahead. (_If you do work ahead, you will be responsible for updating your work if the assignments have changed._)

## Async Lecture RStudio (.Rmd) Files
