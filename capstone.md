# Spring 2026 Capstone Project

Over the course of this semester (and throughout the rest of your academic careers), you will encounter public discourse through various media on the workings, efficacy, and value of higher education broadly and HBCUs specifically. Two of the overarching learning objectives of the Howard University School of Education are to prepare scholars for leadership and to significantly influence the national education agenda through a social justice lens for African Americans. The capstone project for this course will call on you to utilize what you've learned to create a piece of public scholarship (that is, not strictly for an academic audience) that takes a stance and is persuasive in nature.

You may choose your medium. Recommended formats include:
- an OpEd (around 1000 words) for an academic publication, such as Inside Higher Ed or Diverse Issues
- a podcast-style discussion that analyzes a specific topic
- an infographic and narrative (250+ words) on key metrics related to trustee governance and HBCUs
- for other ideas, please run by me first

Rubrics will be provided. You will be graded on quality of content and accesibility to a non-academic audience. In order to make sure you are making sufficient progress, we will use the following dates for drafts and check-ins:
**Draft 1**, due in-class on 2/19
**Draft 2**, due in-class on 3/19
**Final presentation or submission**, due in-class on 4/30.
